# jinja-resume-generator
This is Inspired by a class project. I spent a lot of time styling my own resume so I hope this template generator will help:)
1. Running the program:

```shell
# cd into the resumegenerator
cd resumegenerator

# Run the generator
python __main__.py

# serve up the newly created site and browse to http://localhost:8000/.
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
